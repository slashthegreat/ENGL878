      <p>NATHAN'S farm lay just across the creek
         from ours. He lived in a big white house
         that looked out over a great level stretch of
         meadow where the grass grew knee high in
         summer with the pink heads of sweet william
         just resting on the waving green surface. 
         
       
         
         And
         in winter, from the windows of the sitting-room
         you could look down across the gray grass stubble
         to where the creek made an elbow and reached
         away to the east,-and in the bend the white
         school house stood up against the bare black trees.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Everything about the farm spoke of comfort.
         The cattle were sleek and lazy. The loose horses
         would trot all the way across the pasture to nose
         your pocket for a chance lump of sugar or to beg
         for caresses. Here Nathan lived in quiet 
         happiness until they made him candidate for
         county treasurer. Our family were of a different
         faith politically, but in this case personal preference
         outweighed party feeling and we worked hard for
         our neighbor.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>I remember that on the afternoon before
         election day I went over to Nathan's to do his
         chores. He was away and was not expected
         home. Aunt Sarah, as we boys called her, stood
         in the doorway, her hands clasped over her white 
         
     
      </p> 85
      
      <img src="images/105.jpg" alt="MEATLOAF"/>
      
      
      <p>apron. When I came near, she brought a tin
         pail out to the pump, stepping as easily and lightly
         as a girl. She was a pale, blue-eyed little woman
         and always looked well dressed whether in silk
         or in calico. I could see that she was nervous
         and she dropped the pail with a clatter when she
         tried to hang it on the spout. She sat down on
         the pump platform and chatted to me a few
         minutes.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>You always liked to talk to Aunt Sarah. Her
         words had so much kindness in them,-a
         kindness meant for you, and it soothed and
         flattered you that she was interested in your
         plans. But today she forgot to ask after my
         mother and the doings of the day; she wanted
         political news and I gave her what encouragement
         I could. When I carried the pail of water into
         the house for her she thanked me, but I noticed
         after I had gone out to the barn that she had
         brought a chair to the door and sat looking down
         the road.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>The horses were noisily eating their corn,
         and with many tossings of their horns the eager-
         eyed cattle were munching at the hay I had
         pitched down into their rack, when I heard the
         sound of wheels. I turned about and saw Nathan
         driving in. He waved his hand to me, got out
         and started for the house with his queer limp.
         He was a big man with a red beard and had a 
         fine presence except for his lameness; but he
         got that at Missionary Ridge. Aunt Sarah had
         come flying down to the gate to meet him. She
         laid her hand on his shoulder and he put his arm
         about her, and walked up the path together
         and passed through the door.
         
       
      </p> 86
      
      <img src="images/105.jpg" alt="MEATLOAF"/>
      
      
      <p>I changed horses for Nathan and started home.
         The November sun was low, and a line of bright
         red blazed along the horizon. A few twisted 
         white clouds lay high in the north but there was
         no wind. On the west of the creek the slopes
         were already dark in shadow, but on the east,
         yellow with heavy cornfields and brown with dead
         grass, they slanted down to the winding strip
         of black timber. A flock of prairie chickens
         whirred over my head, and a dozen bold-hearted
         quails ran ahead of me along the path, the leader
         warning and admonishing the rest, pausing to
         watch my approach and then darting on when I
         continued to advance.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>The next night was chill and quiet. The stars 
         were large and bright, and the dark blue sky
         seemed set far back. It was twenty minutes
         past nine when my horse clattered across the
         wooden bridge and the little slope into the
         county town. The vote on treasurer had been
         counted in our precinct, and I was carrying word
         to Nathan and my father. The lights twinkled 
         cheerily on each side of the winding street and
         an occasional dog barked. The upper story of
         the court house showed a line of lighted windows 
         and a noisy crowd covered the steps and walk in
         front. They asked for my news and a part of 
         them greeted the answer with a half cheer.
         
      </p>
      
      <img src="images/105.jpg" alt="MEATLOAF"/>
      
      <p>I stabled my horse and hurried to the hotel. 
         The boy carried a smoking lamp, which he
         shaded from the draught with one hand, ahead of
         me up a flight of narrow steep stairs and along
         a low corridor, the woodwork unpainted and
         scratched, the laths unmasked in rude caricatures.
         
         
      </p> 87
      
      
      <p>where the plaster had fallen. I knocked at and
         entered through a squeaky door, and found my
         father and Nathan alone. The latter looked up 
         from the newspaper on the table and smiled.
         "What was the count, John?" my father cried
         out on the instant.
         "Eighty-four to seventy-eight!"
         "Hum! Some of those fellows wouldn't hold
         to an oath, Nathan. I'll say a few things to one
         or two men that I know-"
         
      </p>
      
      <p>"Well, some of those that took the trouble to
         come around and say they'd vote for me. I didn't
         take much stock in'em. But they've all been good
         neighbors with me and now they've voted it's no
         use worryin' 'em. It'd make you bad feelings."
         
      </p>
      
      <p>I think my father was about to protest, but just
         then a loud rap at the door made him put off
         what he had to say. Ben Dalton, Nathan's cousin,
         the banker at Freesborough, entered. He was a
         short round-bodied man with square shoulders.
         His eyes were small and quick, and a stubby 
         black mustache bristled above a wide mouth. He
         answered my father's "How do you do, Dalton,"
         with a nod, and advanced, his long overcoat
         lapping away from his knees at each quick step.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Nathan's hand was outstretched. "Been to
         Supper, Ben?"
         "No, not hungry. Didn't leave Lafayette till
         seven. Drove down in two hours and forty
         minutes. What's news?"
         "In the first five precincts I have a lead of
         eight. Allen tells me that there is little to hope
         from Lafayette. Briggs brought it up, he says."
         "Allen may be right, but I hope not. Of
         course, Briggs is popular with the bum element.
         He drinks and makes friends that way,-will
         
      </p> 88
      
      
      <p>trade jokes and laughs with 'em, silk hat and all.
         and he's a prominent figure at low sports and gets
         hand clappings that a Sunday school superintend-
         ent can't win. And he wins more of 'em by
         the way he accepts their applause. And then
         jones, and Wilkinson and Ridgeway and the 
         other bankers have all been for him. He's been
         free with promises of deposits of county funds.
         It's wrong. I've never asked you to promise 
         anything. A man ought to have his judgment 
         free so's he can put the money into the best and
         safest hands. But, "and his wide mouth spread
         in a confident laugh, "he won't have the dis-
         posing of that. You'll carry Lafayette. Every
         man that he saw yesterday, I talked to today."
         
      </p>
      
      <p>"Well, if I am elected I'll owe to you, and I
         can never-" Nathan had risen and was leaning
         with one hand on the table.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Nonsense! nonsense, man! What are cousins
         and comrades for except to stand by one another?
         If I ever need your help I shall ask for it. Now, 
         noth another word. I'm hungry and I'm going
         to supper. Excuse."
         
      </p>
      
      <p>"You'll find us at the court house," Nathan
         called out after Dalton's retreating figure. And
         the, to my father, "Ben is a fine fellow. We 
         were tenmates, '62 to '65."
         
      </p>
      
      <p>We pushed through the noisy crowd, wormed
         up the stairs and got in wedgeways through the
         door. The board sat inside the jury railing
         under a haze of smoke that swayed slowly as if
         dizzy with the heaviness of beery breaths.
         They made a place for my father and Nathan up
         near where the count was in progress, Nobody 
         Told Nathan how the ballot stood. My father 
         asked and was not pleased with the answers.
         
      </p> 89
      
      
      <p>On the opposite side of the railed-in square stood
         Briggs, and his coarse heavy face was jubilant.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>The hours dragged on&gt; News came slowly
         and was depressing. My father kept count 
         nervously on a yellow envelope, always anxious
         for news from the next precinct, and always
         finding that Nathan was dropping farther and
         farther behind the estimate, here three, and there 
         four and five. Briggs was gaining in territory
         that we had supposed to be our own. The sound 
         of subdued voices and coarse low laughter filled 
         the room. Nathan leaned wearily against the 
         wall.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>At three o'clock there were still two precincts 
         to hear from, Riverside and Lafeyette. Nathan 
         had twenty-three votes less than Briggs. A
         shout came up from below. "Listen," said my 
         father. The shout was repeated and there were 
         cheers, "Riverside, Williams forty-six. Briggs
         fifty-one."
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Briggs winked to two or three of his hench-
         men, and they elbowed their way out. Two
         newspaper men came around and began to
         chaffer Nathan about his defeat. He answered 
         with an even voice but did not lift his eyes and
         kept his hands in his pockets. My father turned 
         about and laid his hand on Nathan's shoulder.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>"Briggs has gone out to treat over it," he said.
         "Let's get out of here."
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         Well, perhaps-" a shuffling of uneasy feet 
         shifting to rest tired legs, drowned his unsteady 
         voice. Then it came again, "bad news, Sarah's 
         sitting up waiting for me, I know. It'll not be 
         much worse than the waiting has been. She'll 
         be anxious to have it over."
         
      </p> 90
      
      
      <p>They had edged their way almost to the door when there cam a great shout of "Lafayette"
         from outside. "Lafayette, Williams, one hundred and sixty four. Briggs, one hundred
         an twenty-one."
      </p>
      
      <p>As we dashed down the street, twenty or thirty of us, dragging a lumber wagon in which
         Nathan stood bare-headed, Briggs and his friends came to the door of the saloon and
         stared at us. They did not come out. We helped Nathan out of the wagon after we made
         a circuit of the main street. "I must hurry, hurry," he said and he extricated himself
         from the crowd of those eager to shake hands.
      </p>
      
      <p>Nathan installed a hired man on the place when he went away. "I couldn't bear to think
         of renting it," he said. We did not see him often after he went to town. But when
         he could get away he used to come to visit the place and would bring Sarah to come
         stay at out house. She wore fine clothes now, but though full of enthusiasm about
         the social doings of a little town, was still as palce as ever. But Nathan' face grew
         thinner and his forehead wrinkled fast under the new responsibilities.
      </p>
      
      <p>The next year brought new financial troubles to the country. Ban after bank that had
         given easy credit to farmers, had to go down because of short crops and tight money.
         There was talk about Dalton's bank at Freesborough. Only once during this time did
         I see Ben Dalton.
      </p>
      
      <p>Nathan had been at our house for supper, just as in the old times, and we were sitting
         on the front steps, when a man on a sleek black horse came
      </p>    91
      
      
      <p>came galloping up the lane. He sat erect and I knew him at once by the way he carried
         his head. But his hair showed white beaneath his black silk hat, though his stubby
         mustache still held its old color. He refused to dsmount and Nathan went out and stood
         bare-headed patting the horse's mane and talking up to his cousin. The sun glemed
         from the silk hatand from the sides of the sides of the hors. What was said we diid
         not hear. Nathan was plainly refusing something. Ben seemed insistent. Finally he
         galloped away and Nathan limped slowly back, more stooped than usual. But he took
         up the story whhere he had left off.
      </p>
      
      <p>Ben could not have gone more than a mile before he turned, for he was galloping back
         within ten minutes. Nathan went out again. The talk seemed serious. As Ben turned
         to ride away, he raised his voice, "In the morning,"
      </p>
      
      <p>No. Tonight," Nathan called after him.</p>
      
      <p>Ben turned in the saddle and waved his hand as he galloped away. Nathan said, "I must
         go back to town at once." I got out his team and he drove rapidly away, a cloud of
         dust hanging in the air behind his carriage.
      </p>
      
      <p>We wondered if there was anything wrong with Dalton's bank. Of course, when all the
         banks were shaky, rumor was unsparing. We heard that the next day, Dalton handed out
         five thousand to the chief depositor with so calm a face that the man pushed it back
         again.
      </p>
      
      <p>One Saturday, some two months after this, when Nathan's term was almost out, my father
         came home from town earlier than usual. His face was troubled and he went into the
         house before he said anything. Then he began. Dalton's"
      </p>  92
      
      
      <p>"Dalton's bank at Freesborough failed yesterday. There was twenty-seven thousand dollars
         of county money there on deposit. People say all sorts of mean things about Nathan.
         They say that he showed favoritism to Dalton because he was his cousin. His bondsmen
         got wind of the affair and put all of their property out of their hands. So the country
         won't get anything. But the worst is what Briggs said." Then my father banged his
         hand down on the table and got up and wnt out.
      </p>
      
      <p>On the day of the trial a jostling crowd gathered early. Here and there among the
         black clothed towns-people sat a county woman, her shoulders wrapped in plaid shawl.
         Red faced, bush-bearded farmers in brown ducking filled the benches in the back part
         of the room and leaned against the wall. It was nine o'clock when the little judge,
         bald and bespectacled, settled down to rest, chin in hand, on his perch behind the
         high desk. Close up in front a chair was set for Aunt Sarah. It was near a window
         on the right and the curtain was drawn down. Aunt Sarah, in black silk, nervous, and
         paler than ever, came to sit there during the trial.
      </p>
      
      <p>Nathan made a clean breast of it. He had known that Ben's bank was unsafe and that
         it was his duty to draw out the money. But Ben had thought he could pull through,
         so the money stayed. It would have closed the bank the day it came out, and--well,--Ben
         said that it would kill his wife if the bank went down, and he had plans one way and
         another that seemed safe. Of course, these ought not to be reasons to a business man.
      </p>  93       
      
      
      <p>man with the country's interests in his charge. He understood that. He was to blame,--he
         was to blame,--he did not try to excuse himself, but--
      </p>
      
      <p>I suppose that Nathan meant that because of the old school days and the run they had
         taken together up Missionary Ridge, he coildn't help giving Ben a chance. But he did
         not say that. He broke down there. He did not even tell how he had mortgaged all his
         own property and lent Ben the money when the danger first threatened. And while the
         country attorney pleaded with twelve beswindled taxpayers not to heed the sentimental
         drivelings of a man who was trying to work on their feelings, while he was exalting
         their keenness of insight which would not let them be bamboozled by pity for weakness,
         while he was exhorting them to deal out justice,--to make an example that would warn
         future country treasurers, Nathan sat befor the bar with closed eyes and folded arms.
         When the sentence was given. Briggs checked tthe triumphant laugh on his coarse lips
         long enough to say, "Serves Nate Williams right. Damn sneakin', whinin', whitewashed
         Sunday school superintendent, That's all he wanted to get in for,--to cheat honest
         men out of their hard money."
      </p>
      
      <p>Nathan lifted himself then and looked over the crowd, calmy and unashamed. The pale
         little woman in black silk only leaned forward on her hand as if in prayer. She was
         carried out in a dead faint, and when she came to consciousness the fever had seized
         her. She scarcely knew any one for days and when Nathan came to say good by, she did
         not understand what had happened.
      </p>  94
      
      
      <p>Ben was also involved. For him, as for Nathan, the charge of embezzlement of public
         money. But he had falsified his books so as to deceive Nathan, and the jury was harder
         on him and gave him a longer term. So he too wears striped clothes and because he
         cannot bear insults, the stone hammer has blistered his soft palms. It did not help
         matters that Mrs. Dalton died. Ben is only more sullen. He was never beaten before
         and he refuses to be broken now. I saw him, but he pretended not to know me. Nathan
         told me afterwords that Ben refused to speak to him when he had a chance and wouldn't
         even look his way
      </p>
      
      <p>The walls are of cold gray stone and are mounted by turres for watchmen armed with
         riffles. The lock clicks omniously behind you and a dreary chill settles about the
         heart when you see the unpitying rows of iron bars, the stolid guards, and the dull,
         heavy soddenness of the convicts, faces,--men from whom hope has gone, men whose tommorows
         are fixed irrerievably. When I saw it and felt it, it made my heart ache for Nathan.
      </p> 
      
      <p>They let me see him in his cell. On account of his limp they have given him light
         indoor work. His close clipped hair is all gray now, and it is queer to see him with
         clean shaven chin. On a paper on the wall, the days for two years are set down by
         number. There is a line through those that are already gone. When Nathan saw me he
         asked at once, " Did you see Sarah? Is she well and strong? If I could be at home
         to take care of her! Why, when I wake up I can hear her crying in the night. Does
         Sarah

      <p>Sarah ever seem to remember?" And then more questions about Sarah.</p>
      
      <p>Sarah goes lonesomely about among the meager furnishings of her bare home,--a little
         cottage that she rents in the outskirts of town. She stands often gazing proudly at
         a large crayon picture of Nathan, a picture made years ago for the fifth anniversary
         of their wedding. A cousin sends money to her account. She thinks the checks are from
         Nathan and are sent to father to save her trouble.

      <p>I went to see her yesterday afternoon. She was embroidering a pair of slippers for
         Nathan and she brought out a chair for me and went on with her work.

      <p>Ah, they would go back to live on their farm after Nathan came home, as soon as ever
         they could move the renters out. Oh, yes, Nathan wrote. Twice every week, and here
         she grew restless and began walking up and down, as if searching, searching with purpose
         undetermined or foorgotten. But the letters weren't quite satisfactory. He was so
         busy, of course, it couldn't be expected, and they were a little, just a little too
         indefinite, and they always put off the home coming. Nathan was gone so long on this
         business in the east.
